# Odin Recipes

## Overview:
This project is part of the Foundations Course at The Odin Project, aimed at practicing HTML skills by building a basic recipe website. The website consists of a main index page with links to different recipes. The focus of this project is on HTML structure and content, with styling to be added in future iterations using CSS.

## Project Objectives:
- **HTML Fundamentals:** Practice creating HTML documents, including tags, elements, and attributes.
- **Structuring Content:** Organize content effectively using HTML tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
- **Linking and Navigation:** Create links between the main index page and individual recipe pages.
- **Project Organization:** Utilize Git and GitHub for version control and project management.

## Project Status:
This project serves as a starting point for practicing HTML skills. Future iterations will involve styling the website with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript.
